## Introduction

In this report we will be using a random sample of `r count(my_data)` individuals to look at the relationship between a debtor's occupation, number of late payments for debts, debt to income ratio and credit utilization ratio. Then analyse how these variables affect a debtor's credit score.
Furthermore, we will make use of statistical inference techniques to make decisions about the parameters related to debtors and their credit score based on the random sample we have acquired for this report.

The reason I chose this particular dataset is because I am interested in pursuing a career in the financial sector. This project will provide me with valuable foundational knowledge that is essential in understanding the  industry.

## Data

The data we will be using to analyse credit ratings includes the following variables:

-   **`occupation`**: Categorical variable representing the job or profession of the individuals in the random sample. 
For this report we have only included 5 occupations and the breakdown of their numbers is shown in the table below...

-   **`credit_rating`**: Categorical variable, usually a number but for simplicity this time we it as a categorical variable. It represents an individial's creditworthiness. It is determined by looking at an individual's history and repayment behaviours.

-   **`number_of_late_payments`**: Numerically discrete variable. Counts the number of times an individual made a late payment on their loan repayment.

-   **`debt_to_income_ratio`**: Continuos variable. Measures the ratio of an individual's monthly debt payments to their gross income.

-   **`credit utilization_ratio`**: Continuous variable. Represents the ratio of an individual's credit used and the total credit available to the them.

The table below shows how the data is broken down in terms of the occupations of each of the `r count(my_data)` individuals:

```{r}
occupationTable <-table(my_data$occupation)
occupationTable
```

Here is a preview of the first six entries of the dataset:

## Descriptive Statistics/ EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps us understand the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data, often using visual methods.


### Summary Statistics


Summary statistics provide a quick overview of the data. They include measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, range).

```{r summarystats}

# using the skimr package, stating what I'd like to see on the table.
my_skim <- skim_with(
  numeric = sfl(mean = mean, 
                sd = sd, 
                min = min, 
                p25 = ~ quantile(., .25),
                med = median,
                p75 = ~ quantile(., .75),
                max = max),
  append = FALSE
)

# Summary statistics
my_skim(my_data)
```
